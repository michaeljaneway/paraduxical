# PARADUX RULES

## OBJECTIVE

Be the first player to line up FOUR of your tokens in a row — horizontally or diagonally.

## SETUP

- Tokens are placed around the perimeter of the board.
- Remaining tokens go in the center.
- Program (or players) decides who goes first.

## GAMEPLAY

On your turn:

    - Select one of your tokens and one adjoining opponent token.
    - Move BOTH tokens together one space in any direction (horizontal, vertical, or diagonal).
    - Both tokens must be able to move freely.

OR swap the positions of both tokens (this counts as your move).

## CONSTRAINTS

- You CANNOT move a single token by itself.
- You CANNOT move two tokens of the same color.
- You CANNOT make a move that reverses the previous turn.

## WINNING

The game continues with players alternating turns until one player successfully
lines up FOUR tokens vertically, horizontally, or diagonally — thereby winning the game.

## EQUIPMENT

- Hexagonal Board
- Two sets of 10 tokens (different colors)
